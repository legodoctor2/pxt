Advanced users can use a [developer token](/github/token) so that they can work directly with GitHub without having to sign in with the app.

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to [sign up](/github/sign-up) for one first.

## Step 2 - Make code changes

Go ahead and make some changes to the code in your project.

## Step 3 - Review your changes

Make any change in the code editor and you will notice that an up arrow is displayed
on the **GitHub** button. The arrow means that there are changes stored on your computer and they need to get saved to GitHub. Click on that button to open the **GitHub view**.

You will see the list of modified files and their differences, or **diffs**. A **diff** is common jargon used by developers to describe a formatted display of differences between two pieces of text (read about using [diffs](/github/diff)). Look at the diff carefully, it tells you which lines you added, deleted or modified.

#### Reverting local changes

If you do not like some of your changes, you can click on the **Revert** button next to the modified file. It allows you to undo all the changes in that file and roll it back to the content in the previous commit.

## Step 4 - Commit & push changes

Click on the **commit & push changes** button to save these changes to GitHub. This will create a new **commit** in your repository. A **commit** is a bundled set of changes that can be uploaded to GitHub (read more about [commits](/github/commit)).


That's it! Each time you want to keep a set of changes to your code, repeat steps 2, 3, and 4!
